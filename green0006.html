      You bow once more, grateful to the hedges and to their generosity.
          <br><br>
      You look back up at the hedge, wondering if they had any more questions to ask you. These are quite nosy hedges, afterall. The twigs of the hedge begin to blink again as they reignite themselves to full brightness. You guess that puts an end to a stressful night. You walk away from the large wall, following a dimly lit road to the city. The sounds of footsteeps on solid glass echo as you continue on. They grow quieter as the sounds of the city soon grow louder and finally take up the air around you.
          <br><br>
      Along the way, you find that a cactus neon sign catches your eye. You step closer to the window to find that it pretains to a tavern. Looking at the window next to it, you can see that this tavern offers food as well as rooms to spend the night. Walking closer to the tavern, you find its name in neon lights: <b>The Queen Anne's Ace</b>.
          <br><br>
      You walk up to the tavern's door and pause. You reach into your pocket and double check the amount of spades you have with you. You find you have a decent amount to spare a few stays and even a perhaps even a few meals. At least you hope you so.
