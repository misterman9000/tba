      Your adventure begins like any other, with you running through the forest, desperate to outrun the beast behind you. You didn't mean to venture too far off from the main paths. You also didn't mean to run into a werebear so soon before the eclipse. Afterall, it was such a beautiful night under the earthlight, couldn't have been all your fault, now could it?
      <br><br>
      You begin to think that the beast has caught up to you, but you see the bright glow of the colony's hedges up ahead and it drives you to run even faster. You dive yourself in between one of the hedges' segmented gaps and huddle yourself close behind it. You're sure the bright shine of the hedges had scared the beast off but you stay put behind the hedge.
